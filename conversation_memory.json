    "last_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe Pocket link you shared is a fitness\u2011focused article that argues that the classic sit\u2011up\u2014once a staple of abdominal workouts\u2014is no longer the best or safest way to strengthen the core.  It explains why the sit\u2011up is falling out of favor, summarizes the evidence that points to its drawbacks, and suggests modern, more effective alternatives.\n\n---\n\n## What the article covers\n\n| Section | Key points |\n|---------|------------|\n| **The history of the sit\u2011up** | \u2022 Popularized in the mid\u201120th century. <br>\u2022 Became a benchmark for core strength. |\n| **Why it\u2019s \u201cover\u201d** | \u2022 **Injury risk:** increases strain on the lumbar spine, can aggravate herniated discs and lower\u2011back pain. <br>\u2022 **Limited muscle engagement:** works mainly the rectus abdominis but neglects deeper core stabilizers (transversus abdominis, multifidus). <br>\u2022 **Low transfer to daily life:** doesn\u2019t reflect functional movements people do in real\u2011world activities. |\n| **Evidence from research** | \u2022 Meta\u2011analyses that show higher incidence of lower\u2011back pain among sit\u2011up performers. <br>\u2022 Studies comparing muscle activation patterns of sit\u2011ups versus planks or dead\u2011bugs. |\n| **Alternatives that \u201cbeat\u201d the sit\u2011up** | 1. **Plank variations** \u2013 front, side, walking, and dynamic planks that engage the whole core. <br>2. **Dead\u2011bugs & bird\u2011dogs** \u2013 promote neuromuscular control and spine stability. <br>3. **Hanging leg raises** \u2013 strong activation of hip flexors and obliques with less lumbar load. <br>4. **Kettlebell or medicine\u2011ball throws** \u2013 functional, dynamic movements that mimic real\u2011world forces. |\n| **How to transition** | \u2022 Start with planks, then add controlled leg or arm extensions. <br>\u2022 Focus on maintaining neutral spine and breath control. <br>\u2022 Gradually increase hold or rep counts rather than adding heavy weights. |\n| **Practical take\u2011aways for readers** | \u2022 Skip the sit\u2011up if you have a history of back problems. <br>\u2022 Replace it with one or two of the listed alternatives in your routine. <br>\u2022 Track core strength via stability tests (e.g., plank hold, side\u2011bridge) rather than by counting sit\u2011ups. |\n\n---\n\n## Take\u2011away\n\n- **Sit\u2011ups are out of favor** because they are high\u2011risk, low\u2011transfer, and don\u2019t recruit the full core.  \n- **Modern core training** emphasizes **stability, functional movement, and spinal safety**.  \n- The article invites readers to ditch the traditional sit\u2011up, adopt safer and more effective exercises, and focus on overall core health rather than a single isolated movement.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the article\u2019s full detail, you can view the Pocket entry, which usually includes a clean text version and any user\u2011added notes or highlights."
